### How to parse a permissions string:

-rw-r--r--
1222333444

1 = ? (maybe: is it a directory?)
2 = My permissions
3 = Permissions for others in my group
4 = Permissions for anyone logging on to this machine


### Alternatives to bin folders

To run a file/script without using ./ , either:
- move it to a bin folder
- designate its current folder as a bin
- **create a link from a bin folder to its current location**

8 bits = 1 byte
4 bits = 1 nibble (half a byte, geddit?)

Each digit in hexadecimal represents 4 binary bits, a nibble: 0 = `0000`, 1=`0001`, 6=`0110`, 16=`1111`, etc.

MD5 and SHA are 2 types of checksum algorithms. MD5 is older.
