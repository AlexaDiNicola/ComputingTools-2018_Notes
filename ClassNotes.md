### How to parse a permissions string:

-rw-r--r--
1222333444

1 = ? (maybe: is it a directory?)
2 = My permissions
3 = Permissions for others in my group
4 = Permissions for anyone logging on to this machine

- move it to a bin folder
- designate its current folder as a bin
- **create a link from a bin folder to its current location**
