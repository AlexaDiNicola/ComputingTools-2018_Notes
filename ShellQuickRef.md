## Basic shell commands
[back to top](#contents)

### Getting help
- ``command --help``: brief help on ``command``
- ``man command``: manual page, i.e. extended help on ``command``

### Command history
- ``history \| tail -n 17``: list only the last 17 previously-entered commands
- ``!23``: repeat command 23 in the history
- ``^R text``: searches your history for the most recent command matching ``text``; press again to search back from there, etc.
- ``echo !$``: prints last word of previous command
- ``xargs``: after a pipe, passes the prev command’s output as an argument (not standard input)
- ``ls *.txt \| xargs cat``: prints (using cat) the contents of all text-files in current dir

### Special characters
- ``*``: wildcard, matches zero or more characters
- ``?``: wildcard, matches exactly one character
- ``\``: escape character (e.g. to cd into a folder with a space in its name)
- ``$(command)``: command substitution: pass the results of ``command`` as a variable
- ``/``: (as a file-operations argument, alone) the root directory
- ``""``: Lines in double-quotes are interpreted as strings, but variables in them are parsed.
- ``''``: Lines in single-quotes are interpreted strictly as strings — no parsing.

### Shortcut commands
- ``^A`` (Ctrl-A): move cursor to the start of the line
- ``^E``: move cursor to the end of the line
- ``^C``: stop/kill a running program, cancel current action
- ``^Z``: pause a running program
- ``bg``: resume in the background
- ``fg``: resume in the foreground
- ``jobs``: see list of currently-running jobs
- ``ps -u User``: list all running processes started by ``User``
- ``top``: see list of all processes, refreshed, with CPU & memory consumption
- ``kill -9 PID``: kill process ``PID``

## File handling
[back to top](#contents)

- ``pwd``: “print working directory,” i.e. state your current location
- ``cd``: “change directory.” With no arguments, takes you to your home directory.
    - ``cd ../Folder/Subfolder``: go up one level, then into ``Subfolder``, which is in ``Folder``
    - ``cd -``: go to the previous directory (not “up”, but “back”)
- ``ls``: list files in the current directory (“listing”)
    - ``-a``: list all files, including hidden
    - ``-F``: add a type marker to file/directory names
    - ``-lh``: show details, with file sizes in more human-readable units
    - ``-R``: recursively list subdirectories
    - ``-t``: sort by modification time, newest first
    - ``-1``: one entry per line

        - ``-r``: (in reverse order)
- ``mkdir -p zmays-snps/{data/seqs,scripts,analysis}``: Directory creation + brace expansion. Create a directory structure in one line: this one will make a folder ``zmays`` with subfolders ``data``, ``scripts``, and ``analysis``, and a sub-subfolder ``seqs`` in ``data``.
- ``mv filename``: move a file
- ``cp filename1 filename2 … filenameN dirname``: copies ``filename1`` through ``filenameN`` into ``dirname``
- ``rm filename``: remove (delete) a file or empty directory
	- ``rm -r``: delete a directory and (recursively) all files/dirs inside it
	- ``rm -f``: “force” removal without asking for confirmation for each file
	- ``rm -i``: ask, interactively, before deleting each individual file

- ``head file``: print the top 10 lines of ``file``
  - ``tail -n 2 file``: print the last 2 lines of ``file``
- ``wc file``: word count. Returns # of lines, words, & characters in ``file`` (``-l``, ``-w``, ``-c``)

    - ``-type d``: find directories (``-type f``: find files)
    - ``-name pattern``: find filenames fitting ``pattern``
    - ``-d``: set depth: which directory levels will you search? (Default is just the current one.)
- ``grep "and" fish.txt``: within fish.txt, search for the string “and” (“grep” from “global/regular expression/print”)

## Shell scripting

- ``bash scriptname``: execute ``scriptname`` as a bash shell script
- ``{1..9}``: set of the integers 1-9

- ``/dev/null``: “null device”, a black hole: redirect things here to delete them
- ``command &``: execute ``command`` in the background

### Pipes & redirection
- ``command > file``: save output of ``command`` as ``file``
    - ``command > file1 2> file2``: save output of ``command`` as ``file1`` and errors of same command as ``file2``
    - ``0>`` to save inputs, ``1>`` outputs, ``2>`` errors, ``&>`` errors + output
- ``>>``: instead appends output of command as new line(s) at end of file
- ``[line1] | [line2]``: uses output of ``line1`` as input to ``line2``

### Arithmetic
- ``echo ((++i))``: increment i, then print the new value
- ``echo ((i++))``: print value of i, then increment it
- ``((i+=1))``: increment variable i
- ``((i--))``: decrement variable i
- ``((i+=5))``: increase i by 5
- ``((i/=5))``: divide i by 5

### The basic loop
``for varname in listofinputs ; do command ; done
- ``${varname:X:Y}``: return Y characters of varname, starting at position X

### Conditional statements
```
if [ $i -lt 800 ] # (the spaces after `[` and before `]` are REQUIRED)
then
  echo "i is less than 800"
else
  echo "i is not less than 800"
fi
```

#### Some conditional-test expressions:
- ``-z str``: string str is empty
- ``str1 = str2``: strings ``str1`` and ``str2`` are identical.
	- not identical: ``str1 != str2``
- ``int1 -eq int2``: integers ``int1`` and ``int2`` are equal.
	- not equal: `int1 -ne int2``
- ``int1 -lt int2``: integer int1 is less than int2.
	- greater than: ``int1 -gt int2``
- ``int1 -le int2``: integer int1 is less than or equal to int2.
	- greater or equal: ``int1 -ge int2``
- ``-d [thing]``: ``[thing]`` is a directory
- ``-f [thing]``: ``[thing]`` is a file
- ``-h [thing]``: ``[thing]`` is a link
- ``-e [thing]``: ``[thing]`` exists
- ``-r [file]``: ``[file]`` is readable
- ``-w [file]``: ``[file]`` is writable
- ``-x [file]``: ``[file]`` is executable
- ``-o, -a, !``: or, and, negation
- Use ``( )`` to group tests
