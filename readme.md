## Notes Repository: Computing Tools 2018, Alexa DiNicola

These are my class notes for CÃ©cile's 2018 course, Statistics 679: Computing Tools for Data Analytics, offered at UW-Madison in fall semester 2018.

**NB:** My notes are not standalone documents. They won't make much sense unless you have not only the context of the course materials, but probably also a cipher key to my personal shorthand. If you aren't the instructor or TA and you need (or want) actual 
insight into what I'm learning from the course, you're much more likely to get it from asking me personally, or at least asking me to translate these scribbles.
