## Notes Repository: Computing Tools 2018, Alexa DiNicola

These are my class notes for Cécile's 2018 course, Statistics 679: Computing Tools
for Data Analytics, offered at UW-Madison in fall semester 2018.

**NB:** My notes are not standalone documents. They make no sense unless you have 
not only the context of the course materials, but probably also a cipher key to my 
personal shorthand. If you aren't the instructor or TA and you need (or want) actual 
insight into what I'm learning from the course, you're much more likely to get it 
from asking me personally, or at least asking me to translate these scribbles.
